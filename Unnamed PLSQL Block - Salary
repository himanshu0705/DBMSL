Employee( emp_id, dept_idemp_name, DoJ, salary, commission,job_title)
Salary_Increment(emp_id, new_salary)
Consider the schema given above. Write a PLSQL Unnamed Block of code to increase the salary of employee
115 based on the following conditions:
Accept emp_id from user. If experience of employee is more than 10 years, increase salary by 20%. If experience
is greater than 5 years, increase salary by 10% Otherwise 5%. (Hint: Find the years of experience from Date of
Joining (DoJ)). Store the incremented salary in Salary_Increment table.
Also handle the exception by named exception handler or user defined exception handler.



CREATE TABLE Employee(emp_id INT, dept_id INT,emp_name VARCHAR(30), DoJ DATE, salary INT, commission INT, job_title VARCHAR(30));
CREATE TABLE Salary_Increment(emp_id INT,new_salary INT);

SELECT* FROM Employee;
SELECT* FROM Salary_Increment;
TRUNCATE TABLE Salary_Increment;

DECLARE
    t_emp_id INT;

    IF(experience > 10) THEN

    ELSIF(experience > 5) THEN
        new_salary := old_salary * 1.1;
    ELSE
        new_salary := old_salary * 1.05;
